<strong>ABOUT</strong><br>
Website designed and coded with love for Aliments Porat, a cool company from Qu√©bec, Canada that has been around for 30 years and makes vegan products.
The website is a showcase that displays their products, where you can find them, some recipes and Porat vision as a company.
Technology behind the scene involves Html, css and the use of google maps javascript API.

the website can be found here:
http://www.alimentsporat.com

<strong>note:</strong> index.php and .json files were created just to be able to send the website to heroku for testing. They are not useful per say to display the website.

<strong>THE MAP</strong><br>
The website displays a map where clients can find the closest store which sells Porat products. 
As I wanted it to be easily updated by people from Aliments Porat, I created a file in google sheets with the store adresses and coordinates they can edit when needed. The data from the file is gathered and sent to the website by Papaparse.js.
